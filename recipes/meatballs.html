  <h2>Great for pasta's, sandwiches, you name it!</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup Panko breadcrumbs    </li>
    <li>1/3 cup milk    </li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef    </li>
    <li>1 pound ground pork    </li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced    </li>
    <li>2 eggs    </li>
    <li>1 cup (1 1/2 ounces) finely-grated Parmesan cheese    </li>
    <li>1/4 cup finely-chopped fresh Italian herbs (I used half 
        parsley, half basil) </li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated yellow onion</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt    </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper    </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the panade.  In a large mixing bowl, stir together the 
        panko and milk until combined.  Set mixture aside to soak for 
        5 to 10 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients. </li>
    <li>Combine remaining ingredients.  Add the ground beef, ground 
        pork, garlic, eggs, Parmesan, fresh herbs, onion and 
        Worcestershire sauce to the (same) mixing bowl.  Sprinkle the
         oregano, salt, black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes 
         evenly on top.  Use your hands to mix the ingredients until 
         evenly combined, being careful not to over-mix the 
         ingredients.</li>
    <li>Chill (optional step). To make the meatballs easier to form, 
        I recommend covering and chilling the mixture in the 
        refrigerator for 1 hour.  But if you’re pressed for time, you
         can skip this step.</li>
    <li>Prep oven and baking sheet.  Heat the oven to 425°F and line
         a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Form the meatballs.  Using a medium cookie scoop or a spoon,
         scoop and roll the mixture into 2-tablespoon balls and place
          them on the prepared baking sheet.  (I recommend greasing 
          your hands with a bit of olive oil to prevent the mixture 
          from sticking.)</li>
    <li>Bake.  Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until an instant-read 
        thermometer measures the internal temperature of the 
        meatballs to be 160°F.  Remove pan and transfer to a wire 
        cooling rack.</li>
    <li>Serve.  Serve meatballs immediately and enjoy!</li>
